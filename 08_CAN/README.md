- CAN for data frame for tx and rx
- Use Arduino for testing communication between Arduino and BeagleBoneBlack by sending data to arduino and reading responding data from arduino 
- In main.h:
 + TEST_TX_DATA and TEST_RX_DATA is used for testing tx (can_tx.ino) and rx(can_rx.ino)
 + DMA_USED is used to set/unset to use DMA in CAN
